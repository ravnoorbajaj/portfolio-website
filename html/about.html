                    <p>
                        It began when I was a kid and I painted a birthday card for my dad.My family loved it.After I completed my primary school and in the gap between primary and seconday I started painting the walls of my room.Art made me happy.I joined an art gallery and started polishing my skills to draw and paint.

                        <br>
                        I started making different portrait
                        but didn't wanted to limit my creativity on canvas.I went to my cousins place and there I first time say the process of logo making and I just love it.ThenI researched and decided to choose Multimedia.
                        <br>
                        In my bachelors study I learned different softwares to create 2D animations but I wanted to built my carrier in 3D as it is more technical and more engaging.I leaned 3D studio Max and Maya through Youtube and polished my skills at the internship with <strong>Feet and Inches</strong>.Currently, I am persuing my masters from <strong>Algonquin College</strong> in <strong>Interactive Media Management</strong>.And also I am doing a job as 3D modeler under Feet and inches.
                        <br>
                        My family is very supportive ,they never stop me from doing what I want to do. I have knowledge in photography , videography , illustartions, photoshop, manipulation, drawing , audio , acting and a lot more beacuse I have a habit to learn new things and my father always encourages me to do so .No matter what it costs.

                        My hobbies are not limited.I have a lot of hobbies be it playing outdoor games to sitting inside a room alone.One of my favourite hobby is <strong>Art and Creativity</strong>.Also,I have a soft corner for fitness as I have been into Physcial Activities since childhood.
                        <br>
                        I wanted to build my career in the stream where I will not feel trapped rather I would enjoy being my own self .So ,I decided to choose one of my hobby as my future goal.
